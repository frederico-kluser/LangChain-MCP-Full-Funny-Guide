# How LangChain is Used in AI Applications

## Typical Development Flow
1. Definition of use case and requirements
2. Selection and configuration of the appropriate LLM
3. Creation of custom prompts and chains
4. Integration with external data sources when necessary
5. Implementation of memory mechanisms to maintain context
6. Testing and performance optimization
7. Production deployment

## Integration with Existing Systems
- APIs to consume LangChain services
- Modular components for integration in different architectures
- Support for different languages (Python, JavaScript)

## Scalability
- API cost management
- Result caching
- Parallelism strategies
