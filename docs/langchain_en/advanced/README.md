# Advanced Topics

This section covers advanced resources and tools in the LangChain ecosystem that allow you to create more sophisticated applications.

## Advanced Tools

- [LangGraph](./langgraph/README.md) - Framework for orchestrating LLMs in complex flows
- [LangSmith](./langsmith/README.md) - Platform for testing, monitoring, and evaluation
- [Deployment](./deployment/README.md) - Production deployment strategies

## Considerations for Advanced Projects

### Performance and Scalability

LLM applications in production need to consider:

- Result caching to reduce API calls
- Parallelization of operations where possible
- Rate limit management
- Fallback strategies for resilience

### Security and Governance

Advanced implementations need to consider:

- Protection against prompt injection and other vulnerabilities
- Filtering of inappropriate content
- Auditing of interactions
- Traceability of system decisions

### Evaluation and Continuous Improvement

Production systems require:

- Objective metrics for performance evaluation
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement
- A/B testing for optimization
- Monitoring of failures and unexpected behaviors
