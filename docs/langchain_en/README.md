   ```bash
   # For JavaScript/TypeScript
   npm install langchain
   
   # For Python
   pip install langchain
   ```

2. Configure your API keys for language models:
   ```javascript
   // JavaScript/TypeScript
   import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";
   
   const llm = new OpenAI({
     openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
   });
   ```

3. Explore the documentation to understand the components and how to use them in your project.

LangChain is a modular framework that facilitates the development of LLM-based applications, allowing you to integrate different data sources and capabilities to create powerful and flexible AI solutions.
