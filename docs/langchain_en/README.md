2. 🔑 Configure your API keys for language models:
   ```javascript
   // JavaScript/TypeScript
   import { OpenAI } from "langchain/llms/openai";
   
   const llm = new OpenAI({
     openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
   });
   ```

3. 🧭 Explore the documentation to understand the components and how to use them in your project.
